TRANSfer Learning into TWAS framework (TransTWAS)

# About
TransTWAS uses a transfer learning method utilize external tissues' information to predict cross-tissue gene expression. By imposing group-lasso penalty on each row of coefficient matrix, CTIMP reaches higher accuracy and robust prediction over penalized regression trained for each response separately. The approximation procedure proposed for coordinate descent iteration makes training faster and yields small approximation error.
